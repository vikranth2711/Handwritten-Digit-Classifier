# ✨ Handwritten Digit Classifier 🖊️🔢

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Handwritten Digit Classifier** that uses the **MNIST dataset** to classify handwritten digits (0-9). The model is built using **machine learning techniques** and **deep learning models** to achieve high accuracy. It supports both **binary and multi-class classification**, along with performance analysis using precision-recall and ROC curves.

## 🌟 Features
- 🛠️ **Preprocessing:** Image normalization and reshaping for model compatibility.
- 🔢 **Classification:** Binary and multi-class classification using different algorithms.
- 🎯 **Model Training:** Utilizes machine learning and deep learning models.
- 📊 **Performance Evaluation:** Includes precision-recall analysis, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.
- 📉 **Visualization:** Graphs and plots to interpret model performance.

## 📂 Dataset
- The project uses the **MNIST dataset**, which contains **60,000 training images** and **10,000 test images** of handwritten digits.
- Each image is **28x28 pixels** and grayscale.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🐍 **Python**
- 🔥 **TensorFlow & Keras**
- 📚 **Scikit-Learn**
- 📊 **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
- 🧮 **NumPy & Pandas**

## 🚀 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vikranth2711/Handwritten-Digit-Classifier.git
   cd Handwritten-Digit-Classifier
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🎯 Usage
- The script loads the **MNIST dataset**, preprocesses it, and trains different models.
- It evaluates model performance using metrics like **accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves**.
- The final trained model can be used for digit prediction.

## 📊 Results
- The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of **XX%** on the test set.
- Visualizations of training history, confusion matrices, and precision-recall curves are included.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- 🚀 Implement **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for better accuracy.
- 🌍 Deploy the model as a **web application**.
- 🧹 Enhance preprocessing techniques for noise reduction.
