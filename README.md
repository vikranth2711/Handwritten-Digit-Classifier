# Handwritten-Digit-Classifier
This project is a Handwritten Digit Classifier that uses the MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits (0-9). The model is built using machine learning techniques and deep learning models to achieve high accuracy. It supports both binary and multi-class classification, along with performance analysis using precision-recall and ROC curves.
